Collection of different scale- and distribution-based bias adjustment techniques for climatic research. Many of these methods have also been implemented in Python. This can be found here: https://github.com/btschwertfeger/Bias-Adjustment-Python.

## About
This repository started in 2022 as part of a Bachelor Thesis with the topic: ["The influence of bias corrections on variability, distribution, and correlation of temperatures in comparison to observed and modeled climate data in Europe"](https://b-schwertfeger.de/downloads/thesis.pdf)

These programs and data structures are designed to help minimize discrepancies between modeled and observed climate data. Data from past periods are used to adjust variables from current and future time series so that their distributional properties approximate possible actual values.

In this way, for example, modeled data, which on average represent values that are too cold, can be adjusted by applying an adjustment procedure. The following figure shows the observed, the modeled and the adjusted values. It is directly visible that the delta adjusted time series ($T^{*DM}_{sim,p}$) are much more similar to the observed data ($T_{obs,p}$) than the raw modeled data ($T_{sim,p}$).

## Usage example
```bash
./Main.app                           \
    --ref input_data/observations.nc \ # observations/reference time series of the control period
    --contr input_data/control.nc    \ # simulated time series of the control period
    --scen input_data/scenario.nc    \ # time series to adjust
    -v tas                           \ # variable to adjust
    -m quantile_delta_mapping        \ # adjustment method
    -k "+"                           \ # kind of qdjustment ("+" == "add" and "*" == "mult")
    -q 100                             # quantiles to respect 
```
The scipt `example_all_methods.run.sh` serves as an example on how to adjust the example data using all implemented methods. 

All methods to bias-adjust climate data can be found in `/src/CMethods.cxx`. These can be imported into a Jupyter Notebook (with c++ kernel) to test scripts and develop custom algorithms (see `/examples.ipynb`).

## Help
```bash
./Main.app -h
```

## Notes
- For adjusting data using the linear scaling, variance scaling or delta method, you have to separate the files by month and then apply the correction for each month individually. e.g. For 30 years of data to correct, you need to create a data set that contains all data for all januarys and then apply the adjustment for this data set. After that you have to do the same for the rest of the months.
- Formulas and references can be found in the implementations of the corresponding functions.
