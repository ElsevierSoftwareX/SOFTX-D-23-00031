## 1. About

This repository started in 2022 as part of a Bachelor Thesis with the topic: ["The influence of bias corrections on variability, distribution, and correlation of temperatures in comparison to observed and modeled climate data in Europe"](https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/56689/). A technical publication is currently being prepared to provide a detailed description of the application.

These programs and data structures are designed to help minimize discrepancies between modeled and observed climate data. Data from past periods are used to adjust variables from current and future time series so that their distributional properties approximate possible actual values.

In this way, for example, modeled data, which on average represent values that are too cold, can be adjusted by applying an adjustment procedure. The following figure shows the observed, the modeled and the adjusted values. It is directly visible that the delta adjusted time series ($T^{*DM}_{sim,p}$) are much more similar to the observed data ($T_{obs,p}$) than the raw modeled data ($T_{sim,p}$).

## 2. Available methods:

- Linear Scaling\* (additive and multiplicative)
- Variance Scaling\* (additive)
- Delta (Change) Method\* (additive and multiplicative)
- Quantile Mapping (additive and multuplicative)
- Quantile Delta Mapping (additive and multuplicative)

\* The data sets must exclude the 29th February and every year must have 365 entries. Otherwise it is also possible to adjust the data based on long-term monthly means instead based on 31-day long-term means (-15 <= i <= +15 days over all years) using the `--monthly` flag. The `--monthly` flag is required to match the techniques described in the referenced papers but requires that this program is applied on monthly separated data sets. On the other hand the long-term 31-day interval procedures are customized variations and prevent disproportionately high differences in the long-term mean values at the monthly transitions. Thats why the long-term 31-day interval variant is the prefered method and is enabled by default for all scaling-based techniques.

conda activate clingenv
conda install xeus-cling notebook -c conda-forge/label/gcc7
```

## 4. Usage and Examples

The script `example_all_methods.run.sh` serves as an example on how to adjust the example data using all implemented methods.

All methods to bias-adjust climate data can be found in `src/CMethods.cxx`. These can be imported into a Jupyter Notebook (with C++ kernel) to test scripts and develop custom algorithms (see `examples.ipynb`).

Examples:

a.) Additive Linear Scaling based on long-term 31-day interval-means:

```bash
BiasAdjustCXX                        \
    --ref input_data/observations.nc \ # observations/reference time series of the control period
    --contr input_data/control.nc    \ # simulated time series of the control period
    --scen input_data/scenario.nc    \ # time series to adjust
    -v tas                           \ # variable to adjust
    -m linear_scaling                \ # adjustment method
    -k "+"                           \ # kind of adjustment ("+" == "add" and "*" == "mult")
    -o linear_scaling_result.nc        # output file
```

Note/alternative: The regular linear scaling procedure as described by Teutschbein, Claudia and Seibert, Jan ([2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.05.052)) needs to be applied on monthly separated data sets. The `--monthly` flag needs to be used then.

b.) Multiplicative Linear Scaling based on long-term 31-day interval-means:

```bash
BiasAdjustCXX                        \
    --ref input_data/observations.nc \
    --contr input_data/control.nc    \
    --scen input_data/scenario.nc    \
    -v tas                           \
    -m linear_scaling                \
    -k "*"                           \
    --max-scaling-factor 3           \  # set custom max-scaling factor to avoid unrealistic results (default: 10)
    -o linear_scaling_result.nc
```

Note: The multiplicative variant is only prefered when adjusting ratio based variables like precipitaiton.

c.) Additive Quantile Delta Mapping:

```bash
BiasAdjustCXX                        \
    --ref input_data/observations.nc \
    --contr input_data/control.nc    \
    --scen input_data/scenario.nc    \
    -v tas                           \
    -m quantile_delta_mapping        \
    -k "+"                           \
    -q 250                           \  # quantiles to respect
    -0 quantile_delta_mapping_result.nc
```

d.) Help

```bash
BiasAdjustCXX -h
```

## 5. Notes

1.) For adjusting data using the linear scaling, variance scaling or delta method and the `--monthly` flag:

You have to separate the files by month and then apply the correction for each month individually.
e.g. For 30 years of data to correct, you need to create a data set that contains all data for all Januarys and then apply the
adjustment for this data set. After that you have to do the same for the rest of the months (see `example_adjust.run.sh`).

2.) Formulas and references can be found below and at the implementation of the corresponding functions.
